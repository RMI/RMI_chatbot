The Declining Role of Gas As discussed in our recent report, The Role of Gas in the Energy Transition, the pre-COVID patchwork of voluntary and regulatory actions was already failing to drive methane emissions reductions at the scale and speed necessary for climate alignment, the process of aligning operational and investment decisions with a downward path toward long-term decarbonization targets. A weakening of these regulations will only make things worse. Natural gas will play an important but declining role in the energy transition. There is a growing consensus that most, if not all, of the gas currently used in buildings and power plants can and must be replaced with readily available clean energy and clean electricity options. The timeline for phasing out gas in the industrial sector remains uncertain, as global efforts work to scale a range of potential alternatives to both coal andgas, the key thermal energy inputs in heavy manufacturing.\n\nRMI-From-Gas-To-Grid.pdf#page=10: the  growth of charging infrastructure, and explains how  they might be overcome, along with the best practices  for siting chargers and designing electricity tariffs for EV  charging stations.

Gas leakage has been documented widely by the media over the past couple of years. Ongoing aerial surveys and a growing constellation of satellites are finding that methane leaks are far more frequent and intense than previously assumed. Massive methane plumes make it clear that production equipment alone can persistently leak beyond that 0.2 percent threshold. And the 0.2 percent leakage rate considered by industry and EPA is not low enough. Tighter methane detection and reporting will be imperative to protect the climate. Where methane shows up in the gas supply chain Emissions of methane from the gas supply chain fall into two main categories: unintentional and intentional releases.

Therefore, decreasing methane emissions presents both climate and human health benefits. Where Do Methane Emissions Come From? Methane is emitted when organic matter decomposes—a process that is both naturally occurring and manufactured— on timescales from minutes to millions of years. On the millions of years side of the spectrum, buried organic matter decomposes and over time forms methane—the main component of what petroleum geologists call natural gas—in addition to oil and rocks like shale, limestone, and coal. Some methane is emitted naturally from wetlands, geological leaks, and permafrost, among other sources.

At the same time, the rate of reduction in reported  methane emissions has been much slower. And numerous studies show that emissions from  the oil and gas industry are much higher than reporting suggests, both in the United States  and globally. Some scientists suggest that the US EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory estimate  for US oil and gas supply chain methane emissions underestimates the sector’s annual  methane emissions by 60 percent . Others show that this chronic underestimation is a global  phenomenon—and that global inventories underestimate the oil and gas industry’s annual  methane emissions by up to 40 percent .

The time to fix this problem is now. Our best chance to address runaway methane emissions is to tighten up the oil and gas supply chain where large amounts of methane are intentionally vented and unintentionally leaked. Rocky Mountain Institute’s Global Race for Zero Methane Emissions Challenge is doing just that, aiming to reduce climate- change-causing methane impacts of the oil and gas industry by 5.6 billion metric tons of CO equivalent emissions. 2Starting with major oil and gas companies, methane reduction must become the oil industry’s priority, as opposed to being treated simply as a regulatory hurdle. To this end, there are some encouraging signs of commitment by certain companies that recently signed a set of Methane Principles. However, this commitment must be followed up with real action in the form of tens of thousands of methane abatement projects across the oil and gas supply chains.\n\n10347.pdf#page=9: hand, they have come to realize increasingly—particularly the European oil and gas companies—that any future role of gas in the energy system is critically dependent on addressing methane leakage. So working with the oil and gas industry to reduce methane leakage, to reduce flaring, where a lot of methane leaks, is a significant opportunity for us, and we’re ramping up that effort.

A weakening of these regulations will only make things worse. Natural gas will play an important but declining role in the energy transition. There is a growing consensus that most, if not all, of the gas currently used in buildings and power plants can and must be replaced with readily available clean energy and clean electricity options. The timeline for phasing out gas in the industrial sector remains uncertain, as global efforts work to scale a range of potential alternatives to both coal andgas, the key thermal energy inputs in heavy manufacturing.\n\nMethane-Insight-Brief.pdf#page=1: calculated using the 20-year global warming potential (GWP) of 84, as articulated in the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).THE ROLE OF GAS IN THE ENERGY TRANSITION  02  insight brief  ROCKY MOUNTAIN INSTITUTE * WWW.RMI.ORG *   BASALT, CO * BOULDER, CO * NEW YORK, NY * THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA * WASHINGTON, D.C. * BEIJING, CHINA IIIIIII  THE ROLE OF GAS To avoid 1.5 degrees of warming, we need to dramatically reduce global greenhouse gas  emissions over the next two to three decades, including reducing CO2 emissions by at least  45 percent over the next ten years, and completely eliminating CO2 emissions by 2050 .iii This  requires phasing out the vast majority if not all coal, oil, and gas by 2050.

At the same time, the rate of reduction in reported  methane emissions has been much slower. And numerous studies show that emissions from  the oil and gas industry are much higher than reporting suggests, both in the United States  and globally. Some scientists suggest that the US EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory estimate  for US oil and gas supply chain methane emissions underestimates the sector’s annual  methane emissions by 60 percent .

Historically, domestic scrap price and rebar steel price are positively correlated. However, due to the sharp rise in iron ore price in recent years, changing steel prices, and in particular the output-restricting environmental and supervision policies that affect the scrap market, scrap steel prices fluctuate greatly. The monthly fluctuation range reaches tens of dollars and the annual fluctuation range reaches more than $150.

The following examples illustrate these principles.   4  Examples in buildings How much thermal insulation should surround a house in a cold climate? All engineering texts (at least in English) say to specify just the thickness that will repay its marginal cost from the present value of the saved marginal heating energy. But this omits the capital cost of the heating system—furnace, ducts, fans, pipes, pumps, wires, controls, and fuel source. A 1984 sub-arctic-climate house so optimized saved ~99% of its space-heating energy with $1,100 lower construction cost, because superwindows, superinsulation, air-to-air heat exchangers, etc. cost less than the heating system they replaced.

Thedeadline calls for a transition at an unprecedented speed, which means intentional planning and coordinated action for accelerating the changes needed for a sustainable future. Looking Back to Plan Ahead The energy transition is a technological transition. Renewable electricity generation and all technology applications that will follow to replace fossil fuels with electricity will fundamentally change the way we experience energy and pollution even before the end of this decade.

Pilot solutions and iterate quickly: The flexibility of CSS allows for piloting different solutions and quickly iterating based on the results [7993.pdf#page=4].\n\n2. New financing models: CSS developers may turn to new financing models, such as crowdfunding and investment platforms, to reduce finance costs and improve community participation. Community investors may acquire an economic interest in operational projects over time, and community-based owners can adopt a preferred governance and debt structure while enabling tax equity investors to capture tax benefits and reduce overall project costs [7993.pdf#page=7].\n\n3. Credit pass-through and securitization: MUSH (municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals) or utility offtakers can reduce the risk of household default to project owners by acting as the PPA (power purchase agreement) counterparty in a credit pass-through transaction. This helps reduce the total energy cost to local households. Additionally, as the number of projects and household offtakers increase, securitization can be used to further reduce risks [7993.pdf#page=7].\n\n4.

This can include programs that ensure limited-income residents can participate and access the benefits of CSS [31524.pdf#page=9].\n\n5. Streamline permitting and publicize market opportunities: Local leaders can streamline permitting for solar projects, publicize market opportunities to spur local innovation, and reassess the value that they can leverage from both public and private parking facilities. They can also act as an anchor off-taker or guarantor of subscriptions for community solar projects to help increase scale and reduce risks for project developers [31524.pdf#page=9].\n\n6. Integration into utility business models: Utilities can support their customers and set CSS projects up for success by integrating community solar into their business models.

Virtual Net Metering and Community Solar: While net metering policies are designed to compensate electricity consumers who install solar photovoltaics (PV) on their rooftops, virtual net metering and community solar policies allow businesses and residents to capture these same benefits even if the solar installation is not on their property. Virtual net metering has been introduced in at least 16 states, and has been used in Bloomberg’s 1.5 MW installation at JFK airport and by the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to purchase 4.56 MW of solar PV.

Diversification of customer credit risk: Aggregating various types of customers into one offtaker pool improves the overall credit quality of each project (which, in turn, reduces the cost of capital) and eases the reallocation of contracts if a customer defaults. Strong alignment of local interest: CSS can create significant goodwill among authorities that utility-scale solar may not, especially when electricity from a project is made available to a broader swath of a community.

Reduce costs of land through dual- use applications. Viable land-lease prices for solar PV on the distribution grid range from $400 to $5,000 per acre per year. Dual-use applications, such as installing solar canopies over parking lots or colocating agriculture and solar, could eliminate land costs, reducing installed costs by $1–5/MWh. Simplify the solar procurement process. Writing and running an RFP for solar procurement can be a complicated task, and lengthy PPA negotiations can be costly due to mounting legal fees. To simplify the process of buying solar PV, RMI has developed standard RFPs and standard PPAs to use in solar procurement around the nation, greatly simplifying and shortening the solar process.Increase pressure on solar developers to streamline system design.

In March of this year, Puerto Rico’s new comprehensive energy policy (Act 17) became law, putting forth a vision for a more resilient and distributed system, as well as requiring 100 percent of electric power to come from renewable sources by 2050 and 40 percent by 2025, up from 2 percent today. Now the details of how that vision could be met are coming into focus, with the utility’s proposed 20-year integrated resource plan (IRP) under review by Puerto Rico’s energy regulator. This review could wrap up as early as February 2020, with key hearings scheduled for early January. At that point, the regulator can direct the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to follow a certain planning scenario or extend the process and ask for more analysis. The proposed IRP evaluates a wide range of scenarios involving different power plant options and grid configurations, all of which envision significant transformation of today’s system and retiring most of the antiquated power plants \n\n24186.pdf#page=5:  All three plans described above include completing the San Juan project, consolidating the two power plants in the south to one, and establishing a series of smaller mobile gas generators around the island. PREPA proposes the Yabucoa and Mayagüez gas facilities based on a “preferred plan” that appears to be added to the analysis by PREPA. None of the other scenarios – which usedanalytical optimization to select power plant investments – include these facilities, meaning that the IRP analysis never showed it was economically valuable to build these power plants and LNG terminals. This plan is more expensive than alternatives with more renewables.

Puerto Rico’s new energy policy, Act 17 of 2019,  establishes a pathway for increased renewable energy adopt ion to benefit electricity customers and  empowers the regulator to oversee this transition. Recent projects expedited by the Puerto Rico Electric  Power Authority ( PREPA ) and the Public -Private Partnership (P3) Authority of the Puerto Rican  government have circumvented established regulatory processes and risk undermining the goals  established in the new policy.   These projects include the conversion of San Juan generators 5 and 6 from diesel to natural gas —along  with liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructu re in San Juan Harbor —and two new ", "latency": 2.8352, "gpt_groundedness": 3.0, "gpt_relevance": 4.0, "gpt_coherence": 5.0, "answer_length": 1020}

Of these three, it may well be that the dramatic reduction in final energy intensity of GDP based on a dramatic scale-up of energy efficiency and a further shift in the economy to services is the most challenging, as well as the most important. Taking a whole-systems view of the energy transition, including these three pillars, is a robust approach. For the decarbonization of the power sector, the report lays out multiple scenarios.

We assume a gradualretirement scenario for coal-fired plants, that existing gas-fired assets are used to provide balancing energy to integrate new renewables projects, and that firm capacity purchases cover most of the capacity gap left by coal retirement. We find that the energy transition scenario would save approximately $600 million on a net present value basis through 2030, versus continued reliance on legacy coal-fired generation. Minimizing risk In addition to lowering expected costs, scaled adoption of renewable energy would also mitigate risks of rate increases associated with reliance on existing assets for electricity supply. We examined three illustrative risk scenarios for a range of risk factors including increased self-generation from members, member exit from Tri-State’s system, and greenhouse gas pricing. We found that a supply mix based on renewables and purchases, versus legacy assets, reduces the risk of rate increases by 30–60 percent, due to a lower reliance on \n\n12079.pdf#page=4: scenario, rather than reliance on increased nuclear power (which is too expensive) or significant deployment of carbon capture and storage (which is not happening), is the more likely outcome.

Our analysis, and that of others like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, has shown time and again that storage is only one of many balancing solutions for a reliable high- renewables grid. The Risky Business report further notes, as others have, that vehicle electrification is critical to decarbonizing the economy; it also recognizes the less- well-known central role that making buildings more efficient must play—they account for 40 percent of energy use— especially in a warming world where energy for cooling will be in higher demand.

Integrated Resource Planning  Purpose and Overview This chapter provides a basic overview of integrated resource planning for readers unfamiliar with the key  elements of resource planning, specifies who conducts resource planning, and explains why most states require utilities to conduct resource planning. Utility IRPs have historically been tools for utilities and regulators to determine the portfolio of generation  and demand-side resources that can meet projected peak and energy demand over a determined planning horizon at least cost, while mitigating risk and meeting policy objectives. This portfolio is intended to inform a utility’s resource decisions — driving accountability toward actions that result in affordable rates and desired utility performance. Typically, IRPs have a planning horizon of 10 to 30 years, and utilities file new plans every two to five years.

First, they more closely coordinated electricity and natural gas planning in those utilities with both functions. Second, they began the work necessary to allow consideration of load management and conservation as a cost-effective option alongside supply-side generation resources like hydropower, coal, oil, gas, and nuclear power. In theory, IRP is the central place today where VIUs consider the needs and the full suite of supply- and demand-side options, though the options considered vary considerably among different states. Today, IRP goals include traditional values—ensuring safe, reliable, and affordable electricity for all customers within the utility’s franchise service territory—as well as some newer goals.

As the IRP planning process now reaches its close, PREB is faced with the challenging task of directing PREPA on what to do next. While RMI and others have highlighted shortfalls in the plan PREPA proposed—including a bias toward natural gas over renewables—more than enough clarity has emerged from the hearings and analysis to take meaningful action now that can start the transformation of Puerto Rico’s energy system and can provide a much-needed reliability boost to its battered \n\nrmi-growing-risks-implementation-puerto-ricos-energy-transformation.pdf#page=2:  It engages businesses, communities, institution s, and  entrepreneurs to accelerate the adoption of market -based solutions that cost -effectively shift from fossil fuels to  efficiency and renewables.

Puerto Rico’s new energy policy, Act 17 of 2019,  establishes a pathway for increased renewable energy adopt ion to benefit electricity customers and  empowers the regulator to oversee this transition. Recent projects expedited by the Puerto Rico Electric  Power Authority ( PREPA ) and the Public -Private Partnership (P3) Authority of the Puerto Rican  government have circumvented established regulatory processes and risk undermining the goals  established in the new policy.   These projects include the conversion of San Juan generators 5 and 6 from diesel to natural gas —along  with liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructu re in San Juan Harbor —and two new \n\n33397.pdf#page=3:  Together, Rúa, RMI, and over 40 local Puerto Rican stakeholders collaborated on passing a groundbreaking energypolicy into law. Known as Act 17, this law established a variety of landmark legislations including goals for 40 percent renewable energy generation by 2025 and 100 percent by 2050, to ultimately achieve a clean, resilient, thriving future for the island. Here’s what Rúa has to say about the IRA and Puerto Rico: 1. Since Hurricane Maria in 2017, Puerto Rico has had a hankering for resilient microgrids. This desire is only growing during Hurricane Fiona recovery as solar has been a lifeline. Hurricane Maria made it crystal clear that Puerto Rico must move toward a decentralized energy model rooted in renewables. Renewables provide local energy sources that are accessible during an apocalyptic event like Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico spends $3 to $4 billion a year importing fuel. However, investing a fraction of that money in renewable energy sources, particularly harnessing the inexhaustible power of the sun, would mean immediate energy savings to consumers and communities of all ", "latency": 1.668842, "gpt_groundedness": 3.0, "gpt_relevance": 5.0, "gpt_coherence": 5.0, "answer_length": 165}

Demand flexibility reduces system losses When electricity is moved from generators, sent across transmission and distribution lines, and then delivered to end customers, a significant amount is lost along the way. A typical average loss rate for the whole year is about 6 percent, but on peak, the marginal loss rate is much higher—up to 20 percent— because these losses are roughly proportional to the square of demand. That means for an on-peak energy demand, up to 20 percent of the energy used to meet that load is lost as heat before it ever reaches the customer. Using demand flexibility to shift load to off-peak hours, when marginal loss rates are much lower, can reduce generated emissions to meet that load by more than 10 percent. Alternatively, using flexibility to shift load to be coincident with rooftop PV generation means that total energy generation, and emissions, can be reduced up to 20 percent.\n\nrmi_2023_china_power_outlook.pdf#page=39: the penetration by renewables in the power system, the demand for  traditional ancillary services, such as frequency regulation, has increased, as well as demand for new types of ancillary services. The fluctuation of power output by renewables may cause serious imbalances in power generation and consumption during certain periods of the day, such as the rapid decrease of solar PV output at dusk, resulting in insufficient generation in the power grid.  As new energy increasingly replaces conventional synchronous power sources on a large scale, the  proportion of power electronic devices connected to the grid will further increase, which will reduce the synchronous rotational inertia of the power grid and cause a decrease in frequency stability. Therefore, it is necessary to establish inertia ancillary service types to support high-penetration periods of new energy and encourage entities with rotational inertia to operate on the grid as much as possible to provide a rapid response to changes in system frequency.2023 China Power Outlook: 20 Key Trends for Power Market Playersrmi.org  / 40Peak regulation may phase out, as frequency regulation  and reserve ancillary services turn to ", "latency": 4.547885, "gpt_groundedness": 3.0, "gpt_relevance": 4.0, "gpt_coherence": 5.0, "answer_length": 1509}

However, these tools and the results generated by them almost exclusively focus on net-benefit analyses of distribution- or transmission-level energy storage systems, in contrast to the case studies in this report.  Drawing upon the methodologies of existing  modeling tools and software, we developed a simplified dispatch model to illustrate the net value of behind-the-meter energy storage under four generalized use cases in the U.S. Each case centers on the delivery of a primary service to the grid or to the end user. Storage is dispatched primarily to deliver this service and secondarily provides other services based on the relative value of the service, battery availability and state-of-charge, and other user-defined inputs to the model.

An example is the estimated weight difference between the battery electric Lion 8 and the hydrogen fuel cell Nikola One; the Lion 8 has a 480-kWh battery pack with a 250-mile range, which equates to about 2–5 tons. A Nikola One, with a range of about 500-750 miles, is estimated to have a 250-kWh battery pack, which would likely weigh around 2.5-3 tons.

It’s Not Easy Being Green Even though hydrogen gas has no color or odor, to support the decarbonization of heavy transport we will need green hydrogen and a lot of it.

Electric drivetrains are also more efficient than internal combustion engines. With an internal combustion engine, approximately 50% of the energy generated is transferred to heat; but electric drivetrains only lose 10% of their energy to heat. This efficiency difference shows just how much consumers are losing with less efficient internal combustion engines. Price is another attractive attribute of hydrogen. Diesel prices are currently hovering close to $3.00 per gallon, and with the recent curtailment of Saudi Arabian oil production, it’s reasonable to expect further price increases for diesel.

There are still questions around how quickly the production of green hydrogen can scale; the manufacturing capacity for electrolyzers is only starting to significantly ramp up. The main challenges with hydrogen come down to transportation and storage. Hydrogen is produced in gaseous form, and it needs to be stored under pressure or liquified directly. Both of these processes require additional energy, which may or not be from renewable sources. There are emerging methods that use chemical bonds (typically referred to as liquid organic hydrogen carriers [LOHCs]) or ammonia to transport hydrogen in a stable state.

It’s the Same, Only Better One of the benefits of FCEVs is that hydrogen uses a fueling infrastructure that’s similar to conventional trucks. This means that FCEVs could be refueled at existing truck stops across the country and the fueling experience would be similar. A truck can be filled with hydrogen in less than 15 minutes and the process of fueling a FCEV is similar to fueling a diesel truck; hydrogen gas is pumped into the vehicle tank using a gas pump and nozzle that is similar to a traditional diesel pump.\n\n21831.pdf#page=3: advances in commercial battery electric vehicles (CBEVs) are producing technologies and practices that could bring decisive and potentially disruptive opportunities across the transportation industry.

These vehicles come with some challenges as well, the biggest of which seems to be the infrastructure for charging. It’s not an issue to find fueling stations for diesel or gasoline trucks, but fleets that are considering electric vehicles need to make sure there’s a place to recharge—an important factor to consider.

The Women in Renewable Energy (WIRE) network held closed door events, including a luncheon where they discussed approaches to breaking through gender bias and inequities in the Caribbean energy sector. The theme of “scaling” appeared through panel discussions on attracting investment to portfolios of projects, and through notable country commitments like the Commonwealth of Dominica signing a Framework Agreement that will initiate the first large-scale green hydrogen geothermal development in the Caribbean. CREF holds a dynamic panel discussion around how ESG and impact investing practice can translate into capital for renewable energy projects in the Caribbean.\n\n12750.pdf#page=2:  Amory then joined a panel discussion led by RMI’s President and CEO Michael Potts, along with David Allen, EVP of McKinstry, and Rogers Weed, who serves as  Director of the Washington State Dept. of Commerce.

LEDs use at least 80 percent less electricity than an equivalent tungsten halogen source, and have comparatively long life, typically 50,000 hours, or at least ten times as long as the incandescent lamp, according to Carbon Trust. While LEDs have proven a wise investment, Marina Bay Sands initially struggled to find reputable manufacturers. For example, during one of the first phases of retrofitting conventional light bulbs with LEDs, Marina Bay Sands discovered that the new bulbs turned blue and emitted noises when in operation, and subsequently had to be replaced. After reviewing the entire retrofitting process, the team concluded that the failure was due to the LEDs being sourced from a manufacturer which was not reputable and did not have rigorous quality control checks.

Fossil Fuels Got Us into This Mess. They Aren’t Going to Get Us out of It Extreme weather like heat waves, hurricanes, and “polar vortex” events are a major root cause of increased grid reliability concerns, and those events are being driven by climate change — in other words, they are fueled by the burning of coal, oil, and gas. Burning more fossil fuels is not the solution to this problem. Doing so would only perpetuate more extreme weather and events that threaten reliability. The United States can effectively confront this challenge by aggressively building a resilient, carbon-freeelectricity system that includes massive deployment of solar, wind, transmission, electricity storage, and other flexible grid resources. Right now, we have a trillion dollars of renewables projects and batteries sitting in interconnection queues, waiting to get built.

HB6 Will Cost Ohio Customers at Least $400 Million per Year It’s hard to know how much HB6 will cost Ohioans, but $400 million per year seems like a conservative starting point. Its $215 million in annual subsidies and bailout funding could almost certainly be used to procure lower cost electricity on the open market, and propping up uncompetitive power plants will crowd out new, cheaper alternatives for years. On top of this, HB6 eliminates energy efficiency programs expected to save ratepayers $200 million per year, even after removing the fee to fund the state’s RPS program. In the four years following their launch in 2009, these programs delivered $4.15 billion in net savings (i.e., savings minus costs) for Ohio residents, businesses, and local governments—an 800 percent return on investment.\n\n11867.pdf#page=2:  Lovins, has outlined and debunked in a soon-to-be-published Electricity Journal article 14 claimed rationales for mandating or subsidizing uncompetitive coal and nuclear plants.

This means that, for every employee, ratepayers are being forced to spend more than $2 million over the next several years.

Our analysis suggests that, with smart solar-plus-battery investments, customers could see peak pricing emerge, insulating themselves from rising prices for grid-supplied electricity. Meanwhile, traditional grid-supplied customers and completely defected (i.e., off-grid) customers both had much higher pricing from rising retail prices and larger, more expensive stand-alone solar-plus-battery systems, respectively.     • For distribution grid operators  (such as wires-only utilities), the emergence of distributed solar PV and batteries is good news: customers with solar and battery systems should be able to provide value to the distribution grid including upgrade deferrals, congestion relief, and ancillary services.

Phase 1: Solution Search   • Main Objectives:  Identify innovations  with high potential  (e.\n\ntheory_of_rapid_transition_how_s_curves_work.pdf#page=6:  Innovators or  early adopters believe in a faster speed of change and expect a higher return on investment than  those that expect no or slow change.   • They are connected to trusted leaders or peers who are adopting/advoca ting adoption.   • There is plenty of information from trusted sources about the innovation.   • The innovation is accessible, with plenty of resources available to support adoption.   • The perceived level of risk associated with adopting an innovation is within thei r risk threshold.   • There is a clear vision for the future of the innovation.   • There are penalties (legal, financial, social, or otherwise) for those that do not adopt.   Conversely, actors are less likely to adopt if they believe in slow change, perceive a hig h level of risk,  are relatively isolated in their social networks, and have no information or resources to access the  innovation.            5 Exhibit 4.

The Five Phases of the S-Curve   Transitions occur when these incentives and dynamics evolve and the innovation scales.\n\ntheory_of_rapid_transition_how_s_curves_work.pdf#page=3:    • Phase 4:  The innovation reaches mass market as it outperforms incumbents in costs and  performance. This is the steep part of the S -curve.   • Phase 5:  Growth slows as the innovation reaches market saturation. The innovation may be  transferred to new markets or serve as the basis for further innovations.   Barriers and system dynamics are predictable, manageable, and solvable through each of these  phases. This means that as transitions unfold, stakeholders who have a good understanding of  various innovations and their phases can develop targeted strategies to stay ahead of, and take  advantage of, new markets.

As the demand increases, there will be larger-scale manufacturing, which further reduces the cost of these energy-dense batteries.

Harnessing systems dynamics, such as  reinforcing feedback loops, can help us  cost-effectively leapfrog carbon-intensive  technologies. Reinforcing feedback loops  amplify initial causes and effects to generate  self-propagating change.  For example, electric buses can soon adopt  higher energy density batteries that require 50%  less space for the same energy, reducing bus  weight and enabling buses to double storage  capacity at 25% less weight. This efficiency can  improve trip duration, enabling more passengers  to ride the bus on the same battery charge,  reducing cost per passenger. As a result,  demand for electric buses will grow, and they  will earn increasing economic returns, justifying  larger-scale manufacturing and further reducing  the cost of these energy dense batteries.  This can spur further demand both from bus  manufacturers and other sectors, further  reducing cost and improving performance.\n\n38284.pdf#page=5:  As RMI research has found, 2023 was a record year for clean energy as well — with renewables exceeding 80 percent of new power capacity, EVs approaching one in five car sales, and grid battery storage deployments likely tripling. Methane action is also advancing, while Amazonian forest loss declined by half. Emissions may finally fall in 2024, as clean energy outpaces fossil fuels in key areas like China. When solutions scale, they can spark positive feedback loops that accelerate adoption across the world. Researchers have found opportunities across emissions sources — including “super- leverage points” that can help multiple sectors by accelerating key technologies such as batteries and green hydrogen.Once key enabling conditions are unlocked via policy, finance, and infrastructure, these solutions can reach reinforcing feedback loops that improve with implementation. Then, they proceed to enable what few thought possible — like 600-mile EV ranges in China and six days of all-renewable power in Portugal.

For public funders, climate auctions offer a relief from some of the pitfalls of traditional up-front grant financing. Climate auctions can help drive down mitigation costs and leverage private investment, ensuring funders achieve the best bang for their buck. The competitive process also helps funders decide how best to allocate their resources: because climate auctions transparently reveal the minimum amount of finance required to make a mitigation project commercially viable,public funders don’t have to spend time and resources trying to determine the level of subsidy a project needs to be viable and who should receive this subsidy.

Achieving this means ensuring mechanisms adhere to core guiding principles and safeguarding their ability to deliver outcomes that benefit local populations and the climate over private-sector interests.  xvii  For example, regulators may set electricity tariffs below a utility’s cost recovery to make energy more affordable for consumers.

For example, the Mission Possible Partnership is designing pathways to net zero across seven hard- to-abate industries including aviation, cement, shipping and steel. The Race to Zero platform leading up to COP26 provides many examples of leading companies in these industries and others, such as Airbus, ArcelorMittal and Maersk. As crucial leaders of the economy, CEOs have a critical role to play in driving the race to net zero: within their own businesses, among their peers, along their value chains, and in relation to the broader ecosystem of investors and government.

For instance, the  success of innovation at Vermont’s Green Mountain  Power is credited in part to the leadership of Mary  Powell, whose focus on an innovative culture is summed  up in her oft-repeated phrase, “culture eats strategy.”7 DEDICATED STAFFING Garnering leadership support should be followed  by formally allocating staff to designing, planning,  and executing pilots and demonstrations and, where  possible, creating a dedicated team for pilots and  demonstrations. If innovation projects are considered  extra tasks beyond people’s day jobs, they are unlikely  to get the attention and follow-through needed to  drive signiﬁcant impact within and beyond the utility.  Con Edison has dedicated a Distributed Resources  Integration (DRI) group focused on innovation strategy  and demonstration projects, managed by a VP- level leader. This creates focused responsibility for  demonstration projects, which supports the broader  goals of the utility.\n\nReport_PathwaysForInnovation.pdf#page=25:  Convincing  internal stakeholders to support these projects is often  a greater barrier than technical or business model  issues. It is critical that these projects have a champion  who either has the agency to make decisions or is a  key inﬂuencer within the organization. Without senior  support, it is unlikely that the necessary resources  (e.g., funding and staffing) will be allocated to the  projects or that the innovative concepts will survive. In  addition, senior leaders can create linkages between  pilots and demonstrations and strategic planning.  To build this into the organization, utilities should create  formal accountability for key leaders responsible  for innovation efforts. Some utilities beneﬁt from  the passion of leaders who champion the need for  innovation, but if this is not supported by any formal  accountability, innovation efforts are more susceptible  to changing priorities as leaders move on to other roles.
