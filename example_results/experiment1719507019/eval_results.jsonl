Methane is a short-lived but powerful climate pollutant, and the natural gas sector is responsible for significant methane emissions [cae-white-paper.pdf]. Methane has a global warming potential (GWP) equivalent to 28 times that of CO2 over 100 years and 84 times that of CO2 for 20 years [cae-white-paper.pdf].

Natural gas is primarily methane, which has a global warming potential up to 18 times more potent than carbon dioxide [12564.pdf]. Natural gas does have a critical role in the transition to a low fossil fuel energy system, but it should not be relied upon as the dominant primary source of energy [12564.pdf].\n\nOverall, the role of natural gas in the energy transition is complex and depends on the reduction of methane emissions and the development of renewable energy sources.", "context": "cae-white-paper.pdf#page=2:  Of the fossil fuel  energy sources, natural gas has some potential to be an important transition energy source, especially to phase out  coal in areas where renewable sources of energy are not readily available or fit for end-use purpose.

Natural Gas Cuts Carbon, But Not Enough to Mitigate Climate Change While gas can dramatically reduce carbon emissions (compared to coal) and help transition the country to an electric system based on renewables, its ability to reduce emissions does not meet the target set by the of International Panel on Climate Change for 80 percent greenhouse gas reduction by 2050. Natural gas is primarily methane, which has a global warming potential up to 18 times more potent than carbon dioxide. That’s not to say that natural gas doesn’t have a critical role in the transition to a low fossil fuel energy system—it does.

There is a growing consensus that most, if not all, of the gas currently used in buildings and power plants can and must be replaced with readily available clean energy and clean electricity options. The timeline for phasing out gas in the industrial sector remains uncertain, as global efforts work to scale a range of potential alternatives to both coal andgas, the key thermal energy inputs in heavy manufacturing.\n\nRMI-From-Gas-To-Grid.pdf#page=10: the  growth of charging infrastructure, and explains how  they might be overcome, along with the best practices  for siting chargers and designing electricity tariffs for EV  charging stations.

Planners need to  consider how many and what kinds of chargers will be  needed and where, both now and in an autonomous  ride-hailing EV future—preferably without stranding  charging assets along the way. They will need to  consider what the best paths are for charging station  deployment, given sometimes-conflicting priorities specifying that public investments should be low-cost,  high-utility, equitable, free-market oriented, and  expeditious. The current patchwork network of vehicle  charging infrastructure in the U.S. is still small enough  and young enough that we lack sufficient data and  rigorous analysis to answer many of these questions.

Gas leakage has been documented widely by the media over the past couple of years. Ongoing aerial surveys and a growing constellation of satellites are finding that methane leaks are far more frequent and intense than previously assumed. Massive methane plumes make it clear that production equipment alone can persistently leak beyond that 0.2 percent threshold. And the 0.2 percent leakage rate considered by industry and EPA is not low enough. Tighter methane detection and reporting will be imperative to protect the climate.

Therefore, decreasing methane emissions presents both climate and human health benefits. Where Do Methane Emissions Come From? Methane is emitted when organic matter decomposes—a process that is both naturally occurring and manufactured— on timescales from minutes to millions of years. On the millions of years side of the spectrum, buried organic matter decomposes and over time forms methane—the main component of what petroleum geologists call natural gas—in addition to oil and rocks like shale, limestone, and coal. Some methane is emitted naturally from wetlands, geological leaks, and permafrost, among other sources.

The time to fix this problem is now. Our best chance to address runaway methane emissions is to tighten up the oil and gas supply chain where large amounts of methane are intentionally vented and unintentionally leaked. Rocky Mountain Institute’s Global Race for Zero Methane Emissions Challenge is doing just that, aiming to reduce climate- change-causing methane impacts of the oil and gas industry by 5.6 billion metric tons of CO equivalent emissions. 2Starting with major oil and gas companies, methane reduction must become the oil industry’s priority, as opposed to being treated simply as a regulatory hurdle. To this end, there are some encouraging signs of commitment by certain companies that recently signed a set of Methane Principles. However, this commitment must be followed up with real action in the form of tens of thousands of methane abatement projects across the oil and gas supply chains.\n\n10347.pdf#page=9: hand, they have come to realize increasingly—particularly the European oil and gas companies—that any future role of gas in the energy system is critically dependent on addressing methane leakage. So working with the oil and gas industry to reduce methane leakage, to reduce flaring, where a lot of methane leaks, is a significant opportunity for us, and we’re ramping up that effort. We’re looking to make some significant investments. We’re looking for more support because this is one area where we can do something very quickly that can have a real material impact.

Although challenges still exist with performance-based standards and regulations  (e.g., measurement sampling frequency, calibration), outcome-based regulations can foster technology  innovations, enhance emissions monitoring and quantification, and improve GHG accounting practices.  Shifting Methane Emissions to Organics Processing Facilities: We outline several methane abatement  strategies in Section 3, one of which requires diverted organic materials to be converted to other beneficial  end products.

Many existing approaches can be unreliable, owing to factors such as overly simplistic models, poor site- level information being input into models, or infrequent atmospheric measurement sampling.  Advanced technologies, capable of attributing emissions to specific sources and revealing the variable  sizes and durations of methane emissions, are necessary for prioritizing emissions reduction and  determining the effectiveness of proposed solutions.

Policy is needed to rapidly scale up and countries must back up ambitious targets with relevant policy. Other countries must step up with strategies and policies of their own. With the appropriate incentives and policies deployed now, green hydrogen will be cost competitive in the next decade and can be widely deployed to reduce emissions in the most challenging sectors. Policymakers must make concerted efforts to address the immediate green price gap, develop new end uses, and deploy supporting infrastructure for green hydrogen.

Currently, vehicles are purpose-designed but not  optimally used or shared. Electric powertrains,  customized vehicle shapes, and eventually  autonomous fleet optimization change this dynamic.  When designed for specific use cases, vehicles can  be engineered with specific capabilities in mind.In the new mobility paradigm, the shape of a vehicle  can be vastly altered due to the design of the electric  chassis. The electric powertrain releases a number of  vehicle design constraints that apply to ICE powertrains.  For example, the main power source of an electric  vehicle (EV), the battery, is thin relative to the vehicle,  which allows it to be positioned below the cabin,  making a skateboard-like powertrain. Without the bulk  of the ICE powertrain, which needs significant space  and protection, the vehicle cabin can be reimagined.

Not quite. Passive daytime radiative cooling products can cool even during the daytime, even when exposed to direct sunlight, and without any energy input (it’s passive, not active). They take full advantage of the physical properties of radiation — more on that in a moment. PDRC solutions have been developed in many forms, including coatings, thin films, fabrics, cellulosic microfibers, porous structures (like delignified wood), and aerogels. While painting roofs white to cool buildings has been standard practice in hot climates like the Mediterranean for generations, PDRC-equipped roofs take things one step further.

Controls and embedded sensors create intelligence and learning, so design can be opti-mized in real operation and further improved in future applications.  The following examples illustrate these principles.   4  Examples in buildings How much thermal insulation should surround a house in a cold climate? All engineering texts (at least in English) say to specify just the thickness that will repay its marginal cost from the present value of the saved marginal heating energy. But this omits the capital cost of the heating system—furnace, ducts, fans, pipes, pumps, wires, controls, and fuel source. A 1984 sub-arctic-climate house so optimized saved ~99% of its space-heating energy with $1,100 lower construction cost, because superwindows, superinsulation, air-to-air heat exchangers, etc. cost less than the heating system they replaced.

Hydrogen and direct air capture, for example, need to go from prototype to market maturity in the span of a decade, when it took solar PV 30 years to go through its own transition. The figure below shows simplified pathways of historical and ongoing technological transitions to illustratehow unprecedented such speed would be. Further, this innovation process is not linear — as historical cases show — many technologies are likely to regress backward or fail altogether. The public policy approach, therefore, needs to be “entrepreneurial,” in the sense of encouraging failed attempts and embracing risks that are untenable for private capital funders.

However, these incentives weren’t driving EV adoption fast enough for these three communities. Boulder County, for example, has a goal to achieve an 80-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector by 2050. Part of the problem is that tax credits must be claimed at tax time, the spring following the EV purchase. But incentives available at the time of purchase have a far greater impact on EV sales. With the upfront discount, monthly payments are lower, helping to make the LEAF available to more consumers.These economics evidently create a compelling incentive to go electric.

Within the residential solar industry, national leaders are beset by local competitors advantaged by lower customer-acquisition costs. Underlying that local advantage is a shift away from third-party ownership to upfront purchases, either by cash or third-party- provided loans, as households’ familiarity with solar increases, system costs decline, and interest in direct ownership drives a shift away from demand for PPAs and leases. The decline of those offerings creates new opportunities but uncertain implications for the medium-term growth in residential solar.UNDERSTANDING RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES As a result, efficiently financing and developing CSS projects can help pick up the slack and accelerate solar market growth.

Pilot solutions and iterate quickly: Successful financing and business models will leverage the flexibility of CSS to pilot solutions and iterate quickly, taking into account the feedback and needs of the community [7993.pdf#page=4].\n\n2. New financing models: CSS developers may turn to new financing models, such as crowdfunding and investment platforms, to reduce finance costs and improve community participation.

Credit pass-through and securitization: MUSH (municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals) or utility offtakers can reduce the risk of household default to project owners by acting as the PPA (power purchase agreement) counterparty in a credit pass-through transaction. This helps reduce the total energy cost to local households. Additionally, securitization can be used to further reduce risks [7993.pdf#page=7].\n\n4.

MANY OPTIONS EXIST TO MITIGATE RISKS Several key finance-related risks to project owners are highlighted in the report, some of which are particular to projects located in retail electricity markets. These include customer acquisition, short-term subscription agreements, engagement with distribution utilities, market electricity price risk, and regulatory risks (including federal tax policy). As the report details, each of these can present challenges for investors and financiers and should be considered carefully. Where appropriate, CSS stakeholders should act to address these risks in the course of engaging capital partners.In addition, regulators, developers, financiers, and interested communities should be aware of other nonfinancial barriers to scaling the CSS market, including: Interconnection: Nontransparent \n\n7993.pdf#page=3:  At the same time, a growing quantity of new speculative development assumes financing will be available for 10-year PPAs—leaving later cash flows uncertain—based on expectations of continued availability of low-cost debt, even as interest rates are expected to rise. Within the residential solar industry, national leaders are beset by local competitors advantaged by lower customer-acquisition costs. Underlying that local advantage is a shift away from third-party ownership to upfront purchases, either by cash or third-party- provided loans, as households’ familiarity with solar increases, system costs decline, and interest in direct ownership drives a shift away from demand for PPAs and leases. The decline of those offerings creates new opportunities but uncertain implications for the medium-term growth in residential solar.UNDERSTANDING RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES As a result, efficiently financing and developing CSS projects can help pick up the slack and accelerate solar market growth.

Diversification of customer credit risk: Aggregating various types of customers into one offtaker pool improves the overall credit quality of each project (which, in turn, reduces the cost of capital) and eases the reallocation of contracts if a customer defaults. Strong alignment of local interest: CSS can create significant goodwill among authorities that utility-scale solar may not, especially when electricity from a project is made available to a broader swath of a community.

Reduce costs of land through dual- use applications. Viable land-lease prices for solar PV on the distribution grid range from $400 to $5,000 per acre per year. Dual-use applications, such as installing solar canopies over parking lots or colocating agriculture and solar, could eliminate land costs, reducing installed costs by $1–5/MWh. Simplify the solar procurement process. Writing and running an RFP for solar procurement can be a complicated task, and lengthy PPA negotiations can be costly due to mounting legal fees. To simplify the process of buying solar PV, RMI has developed standard RFPs and standard PPAs to use in solar procurement around the nation, greatly simplifying and shortening the solar process.Increase pressure on solar developers to streamline system design. Today, most 1–5 MW solar PV systems are custom designed for a specific site.

Given its role in facilitating coal plant retirements, natural gas is often characterized as a “bridge fuel” to a clean energy future. Utilities and other gas investors expect this bridge to continue long into the future: as of mid- 2019, planned investment in new gas power plants and pipelines totals over $100 billion. However, the rapidly falling prices and improving capabilities of technologies that can combine to form clean energy portfolios (CEPs)—optimized combinations of wind, solar, battery storage, and demand-side management that can provide the same grid services as a gas plant—call into question the cost-effectiveness of investment in new gas infrastructure.

Puerto Rico’s new energy policy, Act 17 of 2019,  establishes a pathway for increased renewable energy adopt ion to benefit electricity customers and  empowers the regulator to oversee this transition. Recent projects expedited by the Puerto Rico Electric  Power Authority ( PREPA ) and the Public -Private Partnership (P3) Authority of the Puerto Rican  government have circumvented established regulatory processes and risk undermining the goals  established in the new policy.

In line with the thinking at RMI, the report highlights the importance of driving energy efficiency, switching to electrification, and finally decarbonizing the electricity supply. Of these three, it may well be that the dramatic reduction in final energy intensity of GDP based on a dramatic scale-up of energy efficiency and a further shift in the economy to services is the most challenging, as well as the most important. Taking a whole-systems view of the energy transition, including these three pillars, is a robust approach. For the decarbonization of the power sector, the report lays out multiple scenarios. In our minds, a high- penetration renewables scenario, rather than reliance on increased nuclear power (which is too expensive) or significant deployment of carbon capture and storage (which is not happening), is the more likely outcome. The report correctly identifies that such high renewable penetration is no longer a technical \n\n20340.pdf#page=5: analyzed an energy transition scenario where coal-fired electricity is replaced with energy from new wind and solar projects, at prices consistent with the results of recent competitive procurements. We assume a gradualretirement scenario for coal-fired plants, that existing gas-fired assets are used to provide balancing energy to integrate new renewables projects, and that firm capacity purchases cover most of the capacity gap left by coal retirement. We find that the energy transition scenario would save approximately $600 million on a net present value basis through 2030, versus continued reliance on legacy coal-fired generation. Minimizing risk In addition to lowering expected costs, scaled adoption of renewable energy would also mitigate risks of rate increases associated with reliance on existing assets for electricity supply. We examined three illustrative risk scenarios for a range of risk factors including increased self-generation from members, member exit from Tri-State’s system, and greenhouse gas pricing. We found that a supply mix based on renewables and purchases, versus legacy assets, reduces the risk of rate increases by 30–60 percent, due to a lower reliance on \n\n12079.pdf#page=4: scenario, rather than reliance on increased nuclear power (which is too expensive) or significant deployment of carbon capture and storage (which is not happening), is the more likely outcome. The report correctly identifies that such high renewable penetration is no longer a technical challenge, but it may still overemphasize the need for larger-scalestorage. Our analysis, and that of others like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, has shown time and again that storage is only one of many balancing solutions for a reliable high- renewables grid. The Risky Business report further notes, as others have, that vehicle electrification is critical to decarbonizing the economy; it also recognizes the less- well-known central role that making buildings more efficient must play—they account for 40 percent of energy use— especially in a warming world where energy for cooling will be in higher demand. And it identifies the great opportunity that exists at the end of life of long-lived infrastructure, and the critical importance of timing transformative investments correctly.

Integrated Resource Planning  Purpose and Overview This chapter provides a basic overview of integrated resource planning for readers unfamiliar with the key  elements of resource planning, specifies who conducts resource planning, and explains why most states require utilities to conduct resource planning. Utility IRPs have historically been tools for utilities and regulators to determine the portfolio of generation  and demand-side resources that can meet projected peak and energy demand over a determined planning horizon at least cost, while mitigating risk and meeting policy objectives. This portfolio is intended to inform a utility’s resource decisions — driving accountability toward actions that result in affordable rates and desired utility performance. Typically, IRPs have a planning horizon of 10 to 30 years, and utilities file new plans every two to five years. Some IRPs conclude with a near-term action plan, commonly two to five years, outlining the utility’s  plan for investments, procurement processes, and customer programs as it moves toward the preferred \n\nrmi_how_build_ceps.pdf#page=29: in the late 1970s in response to volatile and rising electricity prices, considerations around conservation and the “demand side,” and concerns over the viability and cost-effectiveness of planned nuclear resources. 33 At this time, resource plans became “integrated” in two respects. First, they more closely coordinated electricity and natural gas planning in those utilities with both functions. Second, they began the work necessary to allow consideration of load management and conservation as a cost-effective option alongside supply-side generation resources like hydropower, coal, oil, gas, and nuclear power. In theory, IRP is the central place today where VIUs consider the needs and the full suite of supply- and demand-side options, though the options considered vary considerably among different states. Today, IRP goals include traditional values—ensuring safe, reliable, and affordable electricity for all customers within the utility’s franchise service territory—as well as some newer goals. Goals in many states now include policy requirements like RPS goals, carbon reduction goals, specific resource goals (like storage goals), and energy efficiency resource standards.", "latency": 3.888667, "gpt_groundedness": 5.0, "gpt_relevance": 5.0, "gpt_coherence": 5.0, "answer_length": 1031}

This report  provides a technical overview of the decarbonization opportunities available to steadily reduce climate  risks of the global refining sector through 2030. The modern refining sector is over a century in the making. Its increasing complexity is in the growing  uses of petroleum products over time — from kerosene for the first streetlamps and gasoline for the first  automobiles to fuel oil first powering naval vessels in World War I and petrochemicals supporting postwar  prosperity.

The international community’s remaining emission “budget” is less than 1,000 gigatonnes of CO2. The Paris agreement is intended to ensure as quickly as possible that the annual global emissions go down, the budget is stretched, and the net emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced to zero over a few decades. The challenge of limiting the combustion of oil, coal and gas to this budget is enormous in view of the fossil reserves still underground. If we were to use all the known and probable reserves to generate energy, global emissions would amount to around 15,000 gigatonnes of CO2. So limiting global warming to 2C means this: of the 15,000 thousand gigatonnes of CO2, we need to leave at least 14,000 underground.

Demand flexibility reduces system losses When electricity is moved from generators, sent across transmission and distribution lines, and then delivered to end customers, a significant amount is lost along the way. A typical average loss rate for the whole year is about 6 percent, but on peak, the marginal loss rate is much higher—up to 20 percent— because these losses are roughly proportional to the square of demand. That means for an on-peak energy demand, up to 20 percent of the energy used to meet that load is lost as heat before it ever reaches the customer. Using demand flexibility to shift load to off-peak hours, when marginal loss rates are much lower, can reduce generated emissions to meet that load by more than 10 percent. Alternatively, using flexibility to shift load to be coincident with rooftop PV generation means that total energy generation, and emissions, can be reduced up to 20 percent.\n\nrmi_2023_china_power_outlook.pdf#page=39: the penetration by renewables in the power system, the demand for  traditional ancillary services, such as frequency regulation, has increased, as well as demand for new types of ancillary services. The fluctuation of power output by renewables may cause serious imbalances in power generation and consumption during certain periods of the day, such as the rapid decrease of solar PV output at dusk, resulting in insufficient generation in the power grid.  As new energy increasingly replaces conventional synchronous power sources on a large scale, the  proportion of power electronic devices connected to the grid will further increase, which will reduce the synchronous rotational inertia of the power grid and cause a decrease in frequency stability. Therefore, it is necessary to establish inertia ancillary service types to support high-penetration periods of new energy and encourage entities with rotational inertia to operate on the grid as much as possible to provide a rapid response to changes in system frequency.2023 China Power Outlook: 20 Key Trends for Power Market Playersrmi.org  / 40Peak regulation may phase out, as frequency regulation  and reserve ancillary services turn to ", "latency": 5.554109, "gpt_groundedness": 3.0, "gpt_relevance": 4.0, "gpt_coherence": 5.0, "answer_length": 1578}

Microgrids promote infusion of additional private capital to supplement existing sources. The global microgrid sector is expected to grow from $10 billion in 2013 to $40 billion by the end of the decade. Much of the investment in microgrids will come from customers, since the microgrid market in the U.S., which represents 64 percent of the global market according to Navigant, is customer-driven. As electric utilities face the burden of raising huge sums to replace ageing infrastructure, comply with environmental and renewables standards, and deploy smart grid technologies—estimated to add to $2 trillion by 2030—growing customer investment in microgrids can ease the pressure on utilities and rates while simultaneously modernizing the grid.   Microgrids improve the efficiency of the electric system. A microgrid relies on generating equipment that is located close to the demands it must serve. The more a microgrid relies on its generating equipment to meet demand, the fewer units of energy areshipped from central power stations to customers.\n\nExploring_chinas_pathway_to_a_new_power_system.pdf#page=27:  Developing microgrids is an ideal way to establish an observable, dispatchable, and  multiple-energy complemented demand side  A microgrid is a local electrical grid made up of a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy  resources that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the macrogrid. The foundation of a microgrid mainly consists of loads from the demand side, distributed energy sources, and distributed energy storage, which makes it fundamentally different from traditional grid-connected power sources.

The stimulus programs recommended here are by no means meant to be all-inclusive of the full breadth of programs  capable of driving a clean energy future, nor should the absence of other potential options suggest a dismissal of other opportunities. Rather, these ideas reflect Rocky Mountain Institute’s current perspectives on urgent projects with potential for near-term job growth and long-term potential for decarbonizing the US economy.  20 | RMI.ORGIIIIIII  US Stimulus Strategy IIIIIII       ROCKY MOUNTAIN         INSTITUTE 22830 Two Rivers Road Basalt, CO 81621 USAwww.rmi.org © June 2020 RMI.

Fossil Fuels Got Us into This Mess.

Burning more fossil fuels is not the solution to this problem. Doing so would only perpetuate more extreme weather and events that threaten reliability. The United States can effectively confront this challenge by aggressively building a resilient, carbon-freeelectricity system that includes massive deployment of solar, wind, transmission, electricity storage, and other flexible grid resources.

Were these plants to retire, their high operating costs could be invested to buy several-fold larger carbon savings. For example, closing a nuclear unit in the top quartile of operating costs (>6¢/kWh) and respending those avoided operating costs on electric efficiency can indirectly save more COthan closing a coal-fired power plant. While exact values will depend on specific details, it’s possible to procure 2–3 kWh of efficiency for each nuclear kWh not generated, producing greater carbon savings at lower cost while also avoiding the cost of the unneeded nuclear subsidies.

While it is easy to criticize the Paris Agreement for lack of ambition and impact, it reduces some of the risk of completely unpredicted shifts in business environment.   The Only Constant is Change But while our current trajectory is bleak, there is hope. An increasing number of companies and countries are pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or even 2040. Using market cap (or estimates thereof) as a proxy for marketpower, it is clear that the world in the past decade has experienced a significant shift in balance from strong influence of the fossil fuel industries (oil, gas, and coal) toward corporates committed to climate alignment.

Yet decarbonization poses a double-edged sword, as the transition itself can introduce risks. Evolving market conditions, asset revaluation, and regulatory changes can either reduce or exacerbate costs of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. If actors ignore climate change, if assets are left stranded, or if abrupt triage policies become necessary, then climate-related costs will be significantly higher. This dynamic clarifies a role for regulatorsoand policymakers to address the systemic risks introduced by unpreparedness and inaction.", "latency": 4.135275, "gpt_groundedness": 3.0, "gpt_relevance": 5.0, "gpt_coherence": 5.0, "answer_length": 1460}

Coordinated  aggregation of buyer procurement will most likely be necessary to accumulate sufficient demand to support a low- emissions steel product facility. Buyer coalitions can serve as  a powerful platform to aggregate demand across sectors.   The US near-zero emissions steel market is at the precipice of breakthrough steel investment to quench buyers’ mounting demand.

In the financial analysis, several  configurations demonstrated project viability with the benefit  of the recent hydrogen production tax credit (PTC) adding early  project cash flows, improving project valuation, and decreasing  project payback period. Multiple near-zero emissions brownfield and greenfield routes have emerged as positive  investment opportunities. The combination of government  subsidies, preferential financial terms for climate-focused  investments, and market appetite to pay a premium for a low- emissions product have created an opportunity for near-zero  emissions steel to be investable in the United States.  The recommended next steps for producers looking to capture  the US near-zero steel market share and buyers targeting near- zero emissions steel procurement include:  • Build partnerships across the steel value chain  to mitigate  carbon transition risks and secure green infrastructure access.\n\nunlocking_the_first_wave_of_breakthrough_steel_investments_report.pdf#page=9: commitment upon which  contractors can proceed with procurement, construction, design, and engineering plans.
